This program is not mobile friendly. Changes may be made in the future to allow mobile devices. Hover your mouse pointer in the bottom right corner to change the text color or font, or to download or delete the page. Press the tilde (~) key to save your notes. When you save your notes, the ID will be copied to your clipboard. Write this ID somewhere safe so that you can access your notes later. A complete list of all your IDs are also available in the program as backup. When you delete a page, the contents of that page will be copied to your clipboard before **permanent** deletion.  

I hope you enjoy using this program.
